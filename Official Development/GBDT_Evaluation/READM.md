# GBDT Evaluation

## 1. `[OFFICIAL] 3a - Model_Robustness.ipynb`

This notebook assess the 'real-world' model performance using a subset of the dataset that is unseen by the model (i.e., Holdout/Test Split)

## 2. `[OFFICIAL] 3b - Repeated_Holdout.ipynb`

This notebook assess if the model experiences overfitting in terms of performance.

## 3. `[OFFICIAL] 3c - Model_Comparison.ipynb`

This notebook assess if there are any significant differences between two models (e.g., LightGBM vs CatBoost, Default vs Tuned, TB vs IB).

## 4. `[OFFICIAL] 3d - Model_Speed.ipynb`

This notebook assess the speed of the model in terms of training and predicting as measured in seconds and nanoseconds respectively.
