# Evaluation and Comparison of Boosted ML Models in Behavior-Based Malware Detection
**Choa, de Veyra, Escalona, Fortiz**

This is a repository for the Thesis **"Evaluation and Comparison of Boosted ML Models in Behavior-Based Malware Detection"**.

It contains the Jupyter notebook files and datasets used for the development of the study.

## Sections

### 1 - Dataset

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to **Dataset Pre-Processing and Extended EDA**. This also contains the processed datasets (once extracted) that will be used by notebooks under Section 2 & 3.

### 2 - GBDT Training

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to **Model Training and Tuning**.

### 3 - GBDT Evaluation

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to **Model Evaluation and Analysis.**

### 4 - Raw Visualization

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to **Dataset Scatter Plot Visualization**. This acts as an extension to section `1 - Dataset`.

### 5 - PCA

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to **Dataset Clustering and Analysis by PCA K-Means Analysis**. This acts as an extension to section `1 - Dataset`

### 6 - Model Generalization

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to **Model Generalization Test**.

### 7 - Exclusivity Test

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to **Model Exclusivity Test**.

### 8 - Post-Defense

This section contains all notebooks and outputs associated to post-defense revisions of the thesis. The section contains the notebooks for **Trojan-Undersampling Test** and **Benign Peformance Validation Test**.
