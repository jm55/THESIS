# Dataset Clustering

The dataset undergone clustering for analysis. The clustering technique used was DBSCAN as shown in `[OFFICIAL] 1a-1 - DBSCAN_Clustering.ipynb`.

The alternative, `[OFFICIAL] 1a-2 DBSCAN_Clustering_w_FalseLabels.ipynb`, is a version which considers the true raw dataset with the falsely-labelled malicious samples intact. This was used just as a point of comparison for the `1a-1` version.
